1. Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?
Artemis Financial is the client who wants to modernize their operations by adding software security to their public web interface. Specifically, they want to add a file verification step in the form of a checksum when transferring data to ensure secure communications.

2. What did you do very well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing?
It is important to code securely to protect sensitive data from unauthorized access and maintain the company's reputation. Software security adds value to a company's overall wellbeing by preventing data breaches and financial losses. The refactoring of code to add security layers and the use of industry-standard best practices to mitigate security vulnerabilities were done well. It is important to code securely because it helps in preventing data breaches, financial losses, and protecting the company's reputation. Software security adds value to the company's overall wellbeing by maintaining the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of sensitive data.

3. What part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?
The most challenging part of the vulnerability assessment was identifying and addressing potential security vulnerabilities. It was helpful to use OWASP Dependency-Check Maven for static testing to ensure that the code complies with software security enhancements.

4. How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?
The layers of security were increased by adding encryption algorithm cipher, self-signed certificates, secure communication, and functional testing. In the future, a comprehensive security testing tool like Burp Suite could be used to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use.

5. How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
The code and software application were checked for functionality and security by running a secondary static testing using OWASP Dependency-Check Maven and conducting functional testing to identify software application's syntactical, logical, and security vulnerabilities.

6. What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?
The resources, tools, and coding practices that could be helpful in future assignments or tasks include OWASP Dependency-Check Maven for static testing, Burp Suite for comprehensive security testing, and industry-standard best practices for secure coding.

7. Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?
From this assignment, one might show future employers the refactored code, the vulnerability assessment process, and the practices for secure software report that includes an encryption algorithm cipher, self-signed certificates, secure communication, functional testing, and the use of industry-standard best practices for secure coding.
